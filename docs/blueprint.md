## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant blue (#29ABE2) evoking trust and competence, commonly associated with educational institutions. Complement with lighter blues and grays for backgrounds.
- Background color: A very light blue (#E0F7FA), almost white, provides a clean and unobtrusive backdrop that harmonizes with the blue primary color.
- Accent color: A contrasting orange (#FF9800) will draw attention to key interactive elements like CTAs and progress indicators, providing balance to the analogous color scheme.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for its modern, readable style, suitable for both headers and body text.
- Use a consistent set of academic-themed icons throughout the app to visually represent concepts like courses, grades, and statistics.
- Employ a card-based layout with subtle hover effects to organize information clearly and enhance interactivity. Make extensive use of CSS Grid and Flexbox to make the cards responsive.
- Incorporate subtle animations for loading states and transitions between sections to provide a polished user experience.
